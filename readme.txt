Clone your site, plain and simple.


== Description ==

The Semiologic Cloner plugin for WordPress allows to create a complete copy of an existing WP site. It was designed for sites that use the Semiologic theme, but it'll nonetheless work fine on other sites.

To use the plugin, activate the Semiologic Cloner plugin on the site that you wish to copy in addition to the target site. Browse Tools / Clone on both sites.

Fetch the site url and key of the originating site, then paste them into the relevant fields for the target site, and click clone. A few moments later, most of the originating site's options will be copied.

The plugin does its best to do a smart copy of the originating site's information. That is, it will not copy things such as the originating site's name, url, navigation menus, etc. Note that using the Semiologic Cloner plugin on anything but a new site generally is a bad idea: indeed, it'll copy information such as text widgets and the like.

Thus, the best approach to use this plugin is to create and configure a sample site to your liking. When you create new sites, clone the sample site so as to not spend any time on choosing a layout, skin, configuring key widgets, etc.
